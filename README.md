# visualise-suttas
Some scripts for visualising certain relationships between suttas. 

requires installing graphviz in your system then the python graphviz library 

USE: just run the scripts python3 blabla.py see what they do (won't delete your stuff I promise)

TODO:

[1] essentially the same but now do it for Mahijama Nikaya, Digha etc and combine into a single command line app with flags 

[2] instead of outputting an svg or pdf can we use the graphviz file to instead serve to an interactive graph GUI like with d3 in the browser?
